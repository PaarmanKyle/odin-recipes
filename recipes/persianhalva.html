    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Halva is a favorite dessert throughout the Middle East. Many varieties are made with tahini or semolina flour.<br> 
    This Persian version uses a simple mixture of flour, butter, and sugar with the sweet perfume of rosewater. Cut into wedges and serve with tea or coffee.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>½ cup water</li>
        <li>¼ cup rose water</li>
        <li>3 saffron threads</li>
        <li>1 cup unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
       <li>Bring sugar and water to a boil in a saucepan; cook, stirring constantly, until sugar is dissolved, about 5 minutes.<br>
       Stir rose water and saffron into the sugar mixture; cover saucepan and remove from heat.</li>
       <li>Melt butter in a large saucepan over low heat; stir flour into the melted butter until mixture is a smooth paste.<br> 
       Continue to cook, stirring often, until paste turns golden, about 5 to 10 more minutes.</li>
       <li>Slowly whisk sugar mixture into paste until smooth. Remove saucepan from heat and spread halva evenly onto a plate or platter.<br> 
       Make a pattern on the top of halva using the back of a spoon or a knife. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until set, at least 1 hour.</li>
       <li>Enjoy! ^‿^</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Cook's Notes</h2>
    <p>Substitute 1 cup of flavorless vegetable oil for the butter to make a cholesterol-free sweet. Decorate the top of the halva with whole pistachios or almonds or simply sprinkle with chopped nuts. Rosewater is available at most Middle-Eastern stores and at many health food stores.</p>
